# // Overview
# Here, we introduce the concepts of nearcast, orb, and cog.
#
# In the main function, we instantiate an orb. We use a domain-specific
# language to do this, as seen in I_NEARCAST. In the usage below, I_NEARCAST
# defines a single message vector, 'nearcast_note' containg two fields.
#
# Next, we initialise instances of each of the cogs. When they are
# initialised they are attached (subscribed) to the nearcast for the
# messages that they have on_blah methods for.
# 
# The cogs use nearcast vectors to communicate between one another.
# 
# CogSender will be instantiated. As the event loop runs, CogSender receives
# initiative from the orb (orb calls orb_turn). The instance of CogSender will
# count turns of the event loop. On turn #3 it nearcasts.
#
# CogPrint has a method that watches for messages of type nearcast_note, and
# then prints them out. This demonstrates the special role of 'on_blah'. Such
# methods subscribe to the nearcast.
# 
# CogQuitter counts turns, and quits a while longer than the other activity.

            # The next line uses a convenience object that is injected
            # into the cog when the orb initialises it. Internally, this
            # is what it is doing:

            # So why this unusual code injection rather than asking the user
            # to write the code above? Writing to the nearcast is a frequent
            # operation. The usage below is faster and less distracting once
