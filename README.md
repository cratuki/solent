# Project Overview

"What's the pitch?"

Sequencer-architecture platform, currently written in python3, offered under a
free-software license (LGPL).

"What can I get from this that I can't get elsewhere?"

Solent provides tools for creating sophisticated systems using
message-broadcast techniques. As far as I know, this is the first version of
such a system available under a free software license.

There's a tradition of using message-driven techniques to build
high-availability, high-performance systems using these approaches.

Here is a video by former Nasdaq architect Brian Nigiti, "How To Build an
Exchange". https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1e4t2k2KJY

For another prespective, see Leslie Lamport's work on State Machine
Replication (`https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_machine_replication`)

These ideas have not yet gained widespread use. The creator of solent believes
that something like solent will prove to be 'The Railroad of the Digital
Revolution'.

"What is 'message broadcast' all about?"

Mainstream software techniques build systems from nodes or objects. The
messages that pass between the nodes are generally an afterthought to the
behaviour of the nodes themselves. As a result, most software is brittle.

Solent has a different focus. Solent systems are defined in terms of their
message schema. Nodes emerge as a consequence of the message schema. This
leads to much better software, particularly at scale.

"What is 'sequencer architecture' all about?"

Once you have a system of a certain size, you will want to distribute it
across server farms. Since we have defined the system in terms of messages, it
is straightforward to move nodes off their local messaging groups (nearcasts)
to network groups (broadcasts).

But once we reach this scale, we will also want fault-tolerence.

Key to this is to have ordered and reliable messaging. Hence, sequencer
architecture.

"What are the advantages again?"

You can build small things quickly. You can easily scale small things into
large things. You can easily maintain large things.

Solent is a good approach to building embarassingly concurrent problems.
Example: simulations, games, trading systems. It's also effective for building
small staff.

"What components does solent have?"

* Eng: concurrency engine. Uses async networking patterns (e.g. select). Offers TCP client/server and UDP pub/sub. Select loop and scheduling is done for you.

* Nearcast: an in-process mechanism backbone.

* Gruel: general-purpose bidirection asynchronous network protocol. (Nasdaq publish a spec for a protocol called SOUP. Somebody who knew about SOUP would hopefully judge Gruel to be a predictable evolution.)

* Term: general-purpose textual console (currently offers pygame and curses consoles)

* Mechanisms to build create shared libraries from C and access them from python

* Mechanisms for creating binary distributions (uses pyinstaller)

"How evolved is it?"

// Solid functionality

Solent is now effective for building single-process message-oriented systems.
If you wanted to build a complex network app or roguelike game in a single
process, you'd find it to be a sharp tool.

// Memory management

So far, solent development has been sloopy about memory management. Ideally
we'd be deliberately allocating all memory using either the struct library
or the C bridge.

It's possible that a JITting VM like pypy would manage out the remaining
inefficiencies.

Regardless, we've introduced a memory pool, and started to be deliberate about
allocation in the engine core. This is still in the early days.

// Broadcasting

We don't yet have solid redundancy mechanisms in place, and we will
need that before we offer network-based broadcasting.

You could get some distance by wiring nodes together with using supplied Gruel
tools. But that's not at all in the spirit of the system. Where we need to get
to is sequenced broadcasting with a scribe and failover options.

"With all that, what are some things it would be a good foundation for?"

Digital audio studio, alt-coin exchange, clearing house, strategic monitoring
platform, static reference data strategy.

"Where can I learn more?"

The Glossary (docs/glossary.md) gives an overview of the platform's major
concepts.


# Community/Contributions

Except where specifically marked, the codebase will be licensed under the
LGPL, with copyright assigned to the FSF. Contributions are welcome. See
[Contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md)

We aim for this system to be multi-platform with no dependencies on other
libraries.


# Quickstart (unix systems)

This will get you seeing some basic stuff

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cratuki/solent.git

cd solent

bin/arrange_dependencies

# Whenever you open a new prompt, do this to make your
# virtual env active
(cd venv; . bin/activate; cd ..)

# Demo of the solent.eng concurrency system
python -m solent.eng.scenarios

# Install pygame (if you want - you can use curses instead).
pip3 install hg+https://bitbucket.org/pygame/pygame

python -m solent.release.snake --curses
python -m solent.release.snake --pygame

python -m solent.release.roguebox_00_weed_the_garden --curses
python -m solent.release.roguebox_00_weed_the_garden --pygame
```

If you want to understand the network layer, look at solent.eng.scenarios.


# Quickstart (Windows)

Install git for windows (from https://git-for-windows.github.io).

Install python 3.6 (other versions of python3 may work). On the launch screen,
select the option to add it to your PATH. Virtual env comes bundled in recent
releases of python.

Once you are in your git-for-windows shell, you can clone the repository,
create a virtual environment, and activate it. In these steps, be sure to use
the package virtualenv and not the reduced version of it that bundles with
recent versions of python (venv), as they behave differently. For example, you
don't get a unixy activate script with the venv module.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cratuki/solent

cd solent

python -m virtualenv venv

. venv/bin/activate

pip install pygame

python -m solent.release.snake --pygame

python -m solent.release.roguebox_00_weed_the_garden --pygame
```

# Creating an installer/distribution

Here's how you create a distribution. This could be useful if you're trying to
create a release distro on another platform.

```bash
(Install python3.4 or later)

(Install SDL for your platform)

git clone github.com/cratuki/solent
cd solent

#
# // Create the virtual environment
python -m virtualenv venv

#
# // Activate the virtual environment
(cd venv; . bin/activate; cd ..)

#
# // If you didn't install a system-wide pygame, you can install it via pip.
pip3 install "hg+https://bitbucket.org/pygame/pygame"

#
# // Install other libraries we need in the virtualenv
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

#
# // Use pyinstaller to create the packages
#
# This works on unix, but won't work on Windows.
pyinstaller solent/pyinstaller/snake_curses.spec
#
# This should work anywhere that pygame is installed
pyinstaller solent/pyinstaller/snake_pygame.spec

#
# // Look in the dist directory for the resulting binaries
#
```

# What people are saying

"I definitely see the value, having gone through the pain of implementing
get/setsockopt. You've taken the common 5 or 6 steps required to get a BSD
socket up and running and boiled it down to a nice set of options. Kudos."
(Lead developer of a free software operating system project)

"I'm guessing you're off work, how long have you got for all this (really
jealous BTW). (... some evangelism from me about getting involved with the
project ,,,) So when I said jealous I meant of your time, you have time, so
jealous." (Former colleague)

"Apart from that you are apparently still not working? I am not exactly sure
what the problem is - do you need to go in a different direction?" (My mother)
