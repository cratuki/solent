# gruel_press tests
#
# // note
# There are more extensive tests of this found in prop_gruel_client. The
# reason is that this class and the gruel puff are heavily related, and it
# seemed straightforward to develop them against one another. (This does leave
# open the possibility for bugs where they're both wrong, but for this stage
# in the project it's OK. If there's bugs, we will get to them.)
